	// password is not a rejected one, and the default register handler on the
	// private dev line node-auth refuses the pair together, before it hashes or
	// stores anything (node-auth auth.router.ts:518-519, resolved against
	// DevLineRevision). The published reference at ReferenceRevision mounts
	// /register only when the host supplies options.onRegister and has no
	// default handler at all, so it has no code of its own here. See

	// way to deliver the credential a send route just asked for. They are

	// store cannot hold the column, and it is already on the wire as
	// NOT_IMPLEMENTED on these same routes. See delivery.go.

	// The password-reset, email-verification and email-change senders have no
	// NOT_CONFIGURED sentinel of their own: on those three routes the reference
	// sends nothing and still succeeds, so a nil sender is silence rather than an
	// error. Their one sentinel, ErrDeliveryFailed, lives beside them in
	// delivery_password_email.go.
