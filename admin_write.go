// The mutating half of the admin API: sixteen routes that change state, mounted
// behind the guard U12 built and beside the fourteen reads U13 ported.
//
// M8 is split by class of risk rather than by route count, and the invariant
// this file carries is **does it write the right row** — which store method each
// route reaches, with which arguments, and what it answers afterwards. The eight
// credential routes (the API-key and webhook halves, admin.router.ts:1250-1440)
// are deliberately absent: they go together in their own PR, whose invariant is
// secret redaction, because reviewing a masking rule apart from the writes that
// set the value it masks is how a masking rule gets missed.
//
// # What every route here has in common
//
//   - It is mounted with AdminGuard.Protect, never ProtectShell, like every read
//     beside it — a write reached through the marker branch would be worse than
//     a read reached through it.
//   - Its errors are {"error": "…"} — writeAdminError — and not the auth
//     router's HTTPError envelope.
//   - Fifteen of the sixteen answer {"success": true} and say nothing about what
//     changed. The exception is POST /api/tenants, which answers the row it
//     created, and POST /api/2fa-policy, which answers a count beside the flag.
//   - A body that will not decode leaves the zero value in every field and falls
//     into whichever validation branch that reaches, which is where
//     express.json's own failure on these routes also ends up for a client that
//     sent no usable body. adminLogin settled this shape (admin.go); the same
//     treatment is applied here rather than a second one invented.
//   - Required-field checks are the reference's falsy tests and are not trimmed.
//     `if (!role)` refuses "" and accepts " ", so a role named by a single space
//     is created on both sides.
//
// # What none of them establishes
//
// None reads AdminUserFromContext, for the reason admin_read.go gives: the
// principal is unavailable under AdminPolicyOpen and under the legacy secret,
// and no handler in the reference's admin router consults req.user either. So
// nothing here is attributed — an admin console that deletes a user records no
// actor, on both sides.
//
// # Two of the sixteen publish
//
// The two user↔role routes raise identity.role.assigned and
// identity.role.revoked (node-auth admin.router.ts:1002, :1020). The other
// fourteen raise nothing, and that is the dev line's map rather than an
// omission: no admin route publishes a user deleted, a session revoked, a
// tenant created or a role defined, although the names for all four are
// declared. event_publication_test.go pins the whole map.
//
// Both go through (*Auth).publishAdminEvent, which is why these two handlers
// take an HTTPConfig the other fourteen do not: the console sits outside
// EventContextMiddleware on both lines, so the request provenance is read off
// the request at the publication site the way the dev line's own
// publishAdminEvent reads it. That function carries the whole argument.
//
// # Existence, and what these routes do not check
//
// Not one of the six deletes looks the row up first, and not one answers 404 for
// a row that was not there: each calls its store method and answers
// {"success": true} if the call returned. That is the reference's shape and it is
// reproduced rather than tidied, because an idempotent delete that reports what
// it did is a different wire contract from one that always says success.
//
// The consequence is worth stating where a reader will meet it. The reference's
// own stores make those calls silent no-ops for a missing row — `DELETE FROM …
// WHERE id = ?` affects nothing and throws nothing — while this package's
// in-memory stores report not-found (MemoryUserStore.DeleteUser,
// MemorySessionStore.RevokeSessionByID). On such a store a repeat delete is a
// 500 here where it is a 200 there. The difference is the store's and not the
// route's: reading a not-found sentinel to synthesise success would invent a
// distinction the reference's route does not draw, which is the discipline
// admin_read.go already applies to the two absences GET /api/roles keeps apart.

// The write routes' own paths, relative to the admin mount. The other fourteen
// reuse a read path with a different method, or add a parameter to one.

// # What it deletes, and what it leaves behind
//
// One row. The reference calls userStore.deleteUser(id) and nothing else, so the
// deleted user's sessions, role assignments, tenant memberships, metadata and
// linked accounts all survive the account they belonged to. That is not an
// oversight this port is free to read past: the same codebase cascades in the
// *other* direction on the user's own route — DELETE <prefix>/account revokes
// every session, strips every role, leaves every tenant and clears the metadata
// before the record goes (auth.router.ts:1597-1636, ported as
// Service.DeleteAccount) — so the reference knows what the cleanup is and the
// admin console simply does not do it.
//
// Calling Service.DeleteAccount here would therefore be a silent product
// decision, not a port: it would revoke sessions the reference leaves live and
// publish an EventUserDeleted the reference's admin route publishes nowhere. The
// store call is what is reproduced, and the orphans are stated rather than
// swept up. A deployment that wants the cascade has it one call away in
// Auth.DeleteAccount.
//
// # The capability, and the tenant
//
// The reference tests `typeof store['deleteUser'] === 'function'` and answers a
// bare 501 naming the method when it is absent (:810) — no store-not-configured
// 404 above it, because the user store is the one store createAdminRouter is
// always handed. UserAccountStore is this port's counterpart and bundles
// UpdateProfile with DeleteUser, so a store carrying only the second does not
// satisfy it; that pairing is Service.DeleteAccount's already and is not
// re-litigated on an admin route.
//
// The tenant is "", which is adminGetUser's and for the same reason: the
// reference's deleteUser(id) carries none. UserStore reads "" as an ordinary
// tenant value rather than as a wildcard, so in a deployment that stores users
// under a non-empty tenant this route deletes nothing the listing above it
// shows — the same gap the detail route has, and the same store-level item.

// # The walk
//
// offset starts at 0 and the page size is 100. Each page is listUsers(100,
// offset); an empty page ends the walk before anything is counted, every user in
// a non-empty page is updated, `updated` grows by the page's length, and a page
// shorter than 100 ends the walk after the count. Otherwise offset advances by
// 100 and it goes round again. So the walk's termination is "a short page means
// nothing follows", which is exactly the promise AdminUserStore's paging rules
// make — and the reason those rules say a store may not return a short page
// mid-list, and that a non-positive limit must be an empty page rather than an
// unlimited one.
//
// `updated` counts users *listed*, not rows changed. The reference adds
// batch.length whatever the store did with each id (:844), so a policy store
// that no-ops for a user still reports it; the number is what the SPA shows and
// it is reproduced rather than made honest.
//
// The reference updates a page with Promise.all (:843) and this port updates it
// in order. The difference is unobservable on the wire in the successful case
// and is the same partial write in the failing one: Promise.all rejects on the
// first rejection with the rest of the page already in flight, so a failure
// there leaves an arbitrary prefix of the table updated and answers 500 —
// which is what a sequential walk that stops at the first error also leaves and
// also answers. Neither is a transaction and the route promises none.
//

// This is the third of the three distinct answers the reference gives for a

// 501 with an empty page so the table renders (:754), and this answers a bare
// 501 with no users or total at all (:832) — because there is no page here to
// be empty.
//
// The order of the two 501s is the reference's and is load-bearing: the
// require-2FA capability is tested first (:827) and the lister second (:831), so

// asked to write {ui: {...}} replaces the branding block whole. This route
// therefore does the sub-object merge *itself*: read the current settings, spread
// the patch over the stored ui, and send the merged block back down (:979-981).
// The reference's own comment calls that "avoids the GET+PUT race", which it
// only partly does — the read and the write are still two calls and two admins
// patching different colours at once can still lose one — but the merge belongs
// here either way. Moving it into the store would make {ui: {...}} mean
// something different from every other field of the patch and would be a
// different product, not a tidier one.
//
// The merged block is always written, even when the patch is empty and even when
// nothing was stored: `{...(current.ui || {}), ...uiPatch}` is an object in every
// case, so a PATCH with an empty body stores an empty ui where there was none.
