// This file is the declarative half of Config.BuildTokenClaims: three
// constructors that build the hook out of a static map, a field mapping and a
// chain of other hooks, so a deployment whose claims are configuration rather
// than code does not have to write the closure by hand. The consumer's
// security.jwt.extraClaims knob — {claimName: {fromUserField: x} | {const: y}}
// (config-schema.md §1.1, §3.1) — decodes onto UserFieldClaims and StaticClaims
// joined by ChainClaims; its claimsWebhook knob is ClaimsWebhook, next door.
//
// None of this has a reference counterpart. awesome-node-auth has exactly one
// mechanism, the in-process config.buildTokenPayload(user) function
// (auth-config.model.ts:316), and the only behaviour it fixes is the merge: the
// function's result is spread over the six base claims (auth.router.ts:378-384),
// which issueToken already honours for any hook. The helpers are this port's
// own extension (upstream plan, PR 2.3) and produce nothing a hand-written hook
// could not: a token minted through them is indistinguishable on the wire from
// one minted through the closure they replace.

// TokenClaimsBuilder is the type of Config.BuildTokenClaims and of the hook
// WithTokenClaimsBuilder accepts: given the user a token is being minted for,
// it returns the claims to spread over the six base claims. It is an alias, not
// a distinct type, so a plain func literal satisfies both exactly as it did
// before the name existed.
//
// The result may override sub, email, role, loginProvider, isEmailVerified and
// isTotpEnabled; the session claims sid, tid, jti, typ, iss, iat and exp are
// reserved — written after the merge — and cannot be set from any builder (see
// issueToken). A builder error fails the mint: the login, refresh or step-up
// that needed the token answers 500 rather than issuing a token carrying fewer
// claims than the deployment configured.
type TokenClaimsBuilder = func(ctx context.Context, user User) (map[string]any, error)

// StaticClaims returns a builder that adds the same claims to every token: the
// {const: <value>} form of the consumer's extraClaims table.
//
// The map is copied on construction and again on every call, so neither a
// caller that goes on mutating the map it passed in nor one that edits a
// returned result can change what the next token carries. A nil or empty map
// is a builder that adds nothing.
//
// StaticClaims has no error to return, so it cannot refuse a reserved session
// claim name the way UserFieldClaims does: an entry named sid, tid, jti, typ,
// iss, iat or exp is discarded by issueToken on every mint, exactly as the
// same name from a hand-written hook is. A deployment that decodes the
// {const: ...} table should check the names before building.

// UserFieldClaims returns a builder that copies fields of the User into named
// claims: the {fromUserField: <field>} form of the consumer's extraClaims
// table. fields maps each claim name to the User field it reads, spelled as
// the field is on GET /me:
//
//	id, email, role, tenantId, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber,
//	isEmailVerified, isTotpEnabled, loginProvider
//
// A field name outside that list, or an empty claim name, is an error from this
// constructor and never from a mint: a mapping is configuration, and a typo in
// configuration should fail at startup rather than turn every login into a
// 500. So is a claim name that is one of the reserved session claims — sid,
// tid, jti, typ, iss, iat, exp: issueToken writes those after the merge, so
// such a mapping would never reach a token, and a mapping that can never reach
// a token is a configuration error rather than a claim. The six base claims
// (sub, email, role, loginProvider, isEmailVerified, isTotpEnabled) are not
// reserved and may be mapped over, as the reference allows. loginProvider
// reads as LoginProviderLocal when the user has none recorded, as the base
// claim and /me do.
//
// Every mapped claim is emitted on every token with whatever the field holds:
// an empty firstName becomes an empty-string claim, not an absent one. A
// mapping declares that a claim exists; making its presence depend on the
// value would leave a consumer unable to tell "not configured" from "empty".
