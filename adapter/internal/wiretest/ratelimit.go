// The rate-limiter slot: auth.HTTPConfig.RateLimiter, this port of the
// reference's RouterOptions.rateLimiter (auth.router.ts:46).
//
// The reference ships no algorithm — the slot is the whole feature. It
// collapses the option to an empty middleware list when nothing is configured
// (rl, auth.router.ts:468) and spreads ...rl onto every route of the auth
// router, first on each one: ahead of the auth middleware (GET /me, :656) and
// therefore ahead of the double-submit check, which that middleware performs
// and which the one route mounted without it repeats by hand inside its handler
// (:1489-1495). The JWKS document, registered above the chain, carries no rl
// (:490).
//
// That leaves four things to pin, and they are the four cases below: every auth
// route goes through the slot, once; the JWKS document does not, even behind a
// limiter that refuses everything it sees; a limiter that answers is answered
// before anything downstream runs — no CSRF cookie minted, no token verified,
// no store read; and a slot left empty is no change at all. All four run on
// each of the four adapters, because the slot is wired in each of the four
// mounts and an adapter that forgot one route would still pass every other
// group in this suite.
//
// Not asserted: the family's private development line carries a second,
// separate slot on its admin router (AdminOptions.rateLimiter,
// admin.router.ts:211, collapsed the same way at :577) and spreads it onto
// exactly one route, POST /users/:id/promote (:1030) — its admin login route
// (:614) carries none. That path is relative to the admin router's own mount,
// which the host app chooses and which defaults to /admin
// (admin.router.ts:190, openapi.ts:674), not to the API prefix. Those line
// numbers are in that private tree, not in auth.ReferenceRevision, which
// carries no admin rateLimiter at all. No admin route exists in this port, so
// none has a mount to assert against.

// rateLimitRecorder is the limiter under test in the first case: a middleware
// that records the request it was handed and calls through, so "the slot ran"
// is observable without changing any response.
