// This file is the provisioning policy the OAuth callback applies: what happens
// when the provider has authenticated somebody the deployment has no account
// for, or has an account for under a different provider.
//
// The reference defines none of it. GenericOAuthStrategy.findOrCreateUser is
// abstract (generic-oauth.strategy.ts:169-172, google.strategy.ts:67,
// github.strategy.ts:78): the integrator writes the function, and the library
// only knows two outcomes — a user, which handleOAuthLogin turns into a session
// (auth.router.ts:1298-1317), or an AuthError coded OAUTH_ACCOUNT_CONFLICT,
// which the callback stashes and redirects to /account-conflict
// (auth.router.ts:1346-1355). This port cannot ask for that function: its
// consumer configures the library from a file rather than subclassing it, so
// the policy is declarative here and OAuthProvisioning is the whole vocabulary
// a findOrCreateUser would have had. The conflict outcome is the reference's
// and reaches the wire exactly as the reference sends it; the refusals are this
// port's own and are registered in compatibility.go.
//
// The defaults reproduce what this port did before the policy existed: create
// missing accounts, link an address a provider asserts to whatever account
// already holds it. That last one is the account-takeover shape the reference's
// own store interface warns about — two providers can assert the same address
// without representing the same person (user-store.interface.ts:105-119) — so
// OnEmailMatch is how a deployment turns it off, and the conflict flow is what
// it turns into.

// The three OnEmailMatch modes.
