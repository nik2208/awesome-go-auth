// This file vendors the reference's browser assets and records where they came
// from.
//
// Until now this port served its own hand-written UI: an 18 KB auth.js and two
// HTML pages someone wrote by reading the reference rather than copying it.
// That was a standing bet that a re-implementation would stay in step with a
// tree it shared no bytes with, and the bet had already been lost once — the
// comment at the top of ui_test.go is the post-mortem, listing three routes the
// hand-written SDK called that no adapter has ever mounted. Every later
// divergence would have been just as silent, because nothing compared the two.
//
// So the assets are now copies. The reference's own files, at the revision this
// port targets, with a sha256 table and a test that re-hashes them on every
// `go test ./...`. The port cannot drift from the family's UI any more, because
// it no longer has a UI of its own to drift with; it has the family's.
//
// # Why the provenance is beside the bytes rather than in them
//
// Vendored files normally carry a "generated, do not edit" banner, and most of
// these formats would take one — HTML and CSS have comments, and so does JS.
// But a banner is bytes, and these files are pinned by their sha256 precisely
// so that they can be compared against the upstream blob. A file carrying a
// header this repository added is no longer byte for byte what the reference
// ships, and the drift check's first act would be to report all fourteen as
// differing from upstream. (ui-i18n-keys.json settles it on its own: JSON has
// no comment syntax at all, so a banner there would have to be a fake key,
// which every consumer of the file would then see.)
//
// The conflict is real and it is resolved in one direction: the bytes win. The
// provenance lives beside them instead —
//
//   - upstreamUIAssetTable below, one entry per file, naming the upstream path;
//   - ui/upstream/README.md, in the directory itself, which is what a person
//     browsing the tree reads before they touch anything;
//   - the drift test's failure message, which names the file, the expected
//     hash, and the exact `git cat-file` line that restores it — and which is
//     where someone who edited an asset in place actually ends up.
//
// An edit in place is the failure mode this whole design exists to prevent, so
// it is guarded by the thing that runs, not by a comment that can be read past.

// UpstreamUIAssetCommit is the full object name of the awesome-node-auth commit
// the files under ui/upstream/assets were taken from.
//
// ReferenceRevision in compatibility.go abbreviates the same commit and is what
// the deviation register's citations resolve against; this constant spells it
// out because the re-vendoring recipe in the README needs a full object name,
// and because an abbreviation cannot be pasted into `git cat-file` with any
// guarantee that it still resolves uniquely in a tree that has grown since.
// TestVendoredUIAssetsAgreeWithReferenceRevision holds the two together.

// anything dropped in there shows up and has to be declared.
