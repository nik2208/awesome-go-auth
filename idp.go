// An Auth built with WithIDP makes all four adapters mount the same four
// endpoints under the adapter's own prefix, from the same OIDCMounts list, so a
// host that mounts an adapter no longer needs this at all. It stays for the host
// that serves the OIDC endpoints on a mux of its own — under a different base
// path, or behind its own middleware — and for the one that uses the IdP
// without mounting an adapter.
//
// All four are mounted here whatever OIDCMount.ResourceServerGated says. That
// flag is the adapters' reading of HTTPConfig.ResourceServer, and this method
// is handed a mux with no HTTPConfig behind it: a host mounting the endpoints
// itself is choosing the surface itself.
//
// Calling it with the adapter's own prefix, on the mux the adapter was mounted
// on, is a mistake rather than a way to mount the endpoints twice, and it is a
// loud one: both registrations use the same method-less pattern, so the second
// panics at mount time — ServeMux reports the two patterns as conflicting and
// names both registration sites — the same way the JWKS route already panics
// when a host registers it twice. The panic is the point. A pattern that did
// not collide, "GET <path>" against this method-less one, would be accepted as
// the more specific of the two and would leave the endpoint split between two
// handlers, GET answered by the adapter's mount and every other method by this
// one; that silent split is the failure this shape rules out.
//
// The JWKS document is served at basePath + JWKSPath(), the canonical location
// the adapters mount and the one the discovery document points at.
// <basePath>/jwks is kept as a deprecated alias of it, serving the identical
// bytes and headers, for the relying parties configured against the path this
// package published before v0.6.0; the alias is kept through the 0.x line and
// removed in v1.0.0. The deprecated thing is that URL path, not this method:
// the other four endpoints, and the canonical JWKS path, are current.
//
// Both JWKS patterns are registered for GET alone, as the reference registers
// the route (router.get, auth.router.ts:490) and as the four adapters mount it.
// net/http serves HEAD from a "GET " pattern itself, which is Express's own
// fallback from HEAD to the GET handler; any other method misses the route.
