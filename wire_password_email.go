// This file holds the wire conventions for the password-management and
// email-verification group: forgot-password, reset-password, change-password,
// send-verification-email, GET verify-email, change-email/request and
// change-email/confirm.
//
// The shapes are wire-contract §2, extracted from awesome-node-auth@cc01e997
// (src/router/auth.router.ts:777-1071). The catalog, the mappers and the inline
// validations live in the root package for the same reason the rest of wire.go
// does: four adapters serve these routes and none of them may answer
// differently.
//
// Two properties of this group are load-bearing and easy to lose:
//
//   - /forgot-password answers 200 {"success":true} for an unknown address,
//     because leaking which addresses exist is the failure mode the route was
//     written to avoid (auth.router.ts:794-795).
//   - /change-email/request deliberately does the opposite: it answers 409 to an
//     authenticated caller naming an address in use (auth.router.ts:1005-1009).
//     The asymmetry is the reference's, and harmonising either side would change
//     behaviour a shipped client already relies on.
//
// None of these routes issues or clears a token, so bearer-vs-cookie delivery
// does not apply: the only bearer-mode difference is that the auth gate and the
// CSRF check treat a bearer caller as a non-cookie client.

// CodePasswordRequired is the one coded error in this group. Every other failure
// here is code-less in the reference, and a client is documented not to
// pattern-match on an absent code.

//
// This is a deliberate divergence, and the only one on this route. The
// reference's send sits inside the route's try block, so a throwing mailer reaches
// handleError and answers 500 (auth.router.ts:787-798) — which means a known
// address 500s while an unknown one 200s, and an attacker with a broken mail

// exactly that and marks it [UNTESTED] (wire-contract §2, "Anti-enumeration
// caveat: a throwing mailer produces a 500 only for existing users, which is an
// observable oracle"), so no client can depend on it. The port already refuses to
// ship an oracle the reference leaves open elsewhere — SMSVerifyHTTPError answers
// 401 where the reference would answer 404 for the same reason.

// Store failures are NOT swallowed: those still 500, and that oracle *is*

// difference is that a store that cannot persist a reset token has minted no
// credential and served no request correctly, while a stored-but-undelivered token
// is harmless — unguessable, single-use, expiring — so silence costs the caller
