// The read half of the admin API: fourteen routes, every one of them a GET,
// mounted behind the guard U12 built.
//
// M8 is split by class of risk rather than by route count, and the invariant
// this file carries is shape against shape — each response body is the
// reference handler's, field for field, and nothing here writes. The three
// files that follow own the mutations, the secret redaction and the upload
// surface; the two reads that belong to those classes rather than to this one
// (GET /api/api-keys at :1253 and GET /api/webhooks at :1363) are deliberately
// absent, because the webhook listing masks its secret to "***" and reviewing
// that apart from the writes that set the value is how a masking rule gets
// missed.
//
// # What every route here has in common
//
//   - It is mounted with AdminGuard.Protect, never ProtectShell. The marker
//     branch belongs to the login shell alone; see the
//     admin-unauthenticated-get-serves-only-the-login-form deviation for what
//     GET /admin/api/users would otherwise be.
//   - Its errors are {"error": "…"} — writeAdminError — and not the auth
//     router's HTTPError envelope. The admin router is a second router and
//     carries none of the first one's conventions.
//   - A store it needs and does not have is a 404 naming the store, and a store
//     it has that cannot enumerate is a 501 naming the method. Those are two
//     different absences and the reference keeps them apart by asking whether it
//     was given a store, never by reading an error (:1130 against :1133); this
//     port's ErrFeatureNotSupported collapses them, so the check on the store
//     comes first and the sentinel is only ever read afterwards.
//   - A list is always a non-nil slice, so an empty one serialises as [] and not
//     as null. Every shipped client iterates these.
//
// # What none of them establishes
//
// None reads AdminUserFromContext. The principal is unavailable under
// AdminPolicyOpen and under the legacy secret — both authorise without
// identifying — and no route in the reference's read half consults req.user
// either: the console shows the deployment, not the administrator. A route that
// did need an id would have to handle the false second result rather than
// assume it.

// The read routes, relative to the admin mount. Eight are fixed paths; the six
// that carry a path parameter are matched by matchAdminRead below.

// It is deliberately not PublicUser. Three of these keys PublicUser does not

// isAdmin is absent, and its absence is the reference's rather than a choice
// made here: the reference serialises that field nowhere at all, this route
// included. See User.IsAdmin.
//
// The three optional strings and createdAt are omitempty because the

// is optional on BaseUser (user.model.ts:5, :26, :32, :37, :39) and createdAt is
// not declared on it at all, which is why the handler reaches for it through an
// index expression — and JSON.stringify omits an undefined member rather than

// cannot tell a stored false from an absent field, and false is what every store
// that has the column reports.

//
//   - limit defaults to 20 and is clamped to 100; offset defaults to 0. Neither
//     is clamped from below — a negative limit reaches the store, which answers
//     an empty page by the contract on AdminUserStore, and a negative offset
//     reaches both the store and the reported total.
//   - A filter fetches a 500-row batch at offset 0 and filters it in memory on
//     an email-or-id substring. It is best-effort by construction: a deployment
//     with more than 500 users cannot find the 501st by typing its address, and
//     the reference says so in a comment rather than fixing it (:759-761).
//   - The filtered page is the batch sliced [offset, offset+limit), and total is
//     the length before the slice — so under a filter total is exact.
//   - Unfiltered, total is `len(page) + offset + (len(page) == limit ? 1 : 0)`,
//     whose only job is to tell the table whether to draw a "next" button, and
//     which is off by one whenever the last page happens to be exactly full.
//     That is the arithmetic, and reproducing it is the point: a table that
