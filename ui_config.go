// later; UIOptions.Assets and UIOptions.Uploads are where they will read from.

// The branding defaults. They are the reference's literals
// (ui.router.ts:126-129, repeated in its error fallback at :149-151) and are
// wire values rather than a claim about who wrote the server: the family's
// clients render siteName as the page heading, so a port that substituted a

// "config" and never the login page's strings, whatever the UI is about to

	// them unmounted, so an unconfigured deployment answers 404 there rather
	// than failing on a store it does not have.
	//
	// It is read-only on purpose. The reference's upload *writer* is an admin
	// route, and this port has no UploadStore to write through until U15; making
	// the read side an fs.FS now means the store, when it lands, has to supply

//     configured mailer for the three email ones and config.sms for the other
//     (:116-121); this port has no mailer block on Config, so the sender is the
//     whole condition.
//   - verifyEmail additionally requires the deployment to want verification at
//     all: Config.EmailVerificationMode other than none, as normalised by the
//     service. The reference asks emailVerificationMode !== 'none' ||
//     requireEmailVerification (:121), and an unset mode passes that test while

//     reasoning lives.
//   - google and github report a configured OAuth provider of that name
//     (:118-119, WithOAuth here).
//   - twoFactor is Config.TwoFactorAppName, this port's spelling of the

//     (auth-config.model.ts:272-274, ui.router.ts:122). Config.Require2FA is not
