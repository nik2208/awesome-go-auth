// This file holds the second-factor branch of POST /login: the answer that hands
// a client the step-up token every route in wire-contract §3 asks for.
//
// Before it, Service.Login answered a 2FA-gated account with
// ErrTwoFactorRequired and nothing else, which HTTPErrorFor spells
// 403 {"error":"Two-factor authentication required","code":"2FA_REQUIRED"}. That
// body carries no tempToken, and /2fa/verify plus /sms/{send,verify} and
// /magic-link/{send,verify} in mode:"2fa" all need one — so the entire step-up
// half of the contract was unreachable over HTTP even though those routes were
// implemented and tested. The tests minted their own tempToken, which is why the
// gap survived (issue #42).
//
// Why the challenge does not travel in the HTTPError envelope. Two reasons, and
// the first settles it on its own:
//
//   - It is not an error. The reference answers the challenge
//     200 {"requiresTwoFactor":true,"tempToken":"<jwt>","available2faMethods":[…]}
//     (auth.router.ts:572-577) — no "error" member, no "code", and the identical
//     body in bearer and cookie mode because no session exists yet. The 403 this
//     port used to send was a deviation, and a recorded one:
//     docs/spec/parity-gap-node-vs-go.md row 1 marks local login "diverges" and
//     names the missing challenge. Its sibling branch is a 403 but is equally not
//     the envelope: {"requires2FASetup":true,"tempToken":"<jwt>",
//     "code":"2FA_SETUP_REQUIRED"} (:568) carries a code and no message.
//   - HTTPError is shared by every route in the package. Widening it would put
//     two more `omitempty` members on all thirty-odd catalog entries for the sake
//     of one branch, and a []string member would make HTTPError non-comparable —
//     wire_test.go keys a map on the value and TestErrorMapping compares entries
//     with ==, so the catalog is comparable by design, not by accident.
//
// So the two bodies are written directly, by WriteTwoFactorChallenge, and
// HTTPErrTwoFactorRequired stays in the catalog for a direct Service.Login caller
// that surfaces the sentinel through WriteServiceError.

// Second-factor method names, exactly as the reference spells them in
// available2faMethods (auth.router.ts:557-559). A client picks its next request
// from this list, so these strings are wire: "magic-link" is hyphenated and
// nothing is capitalised.

// and a value that also held the User would hand a password hash and a TOTP
// secret to anything that logs a challenge.

// could only learn it from a successfully built challenge then a deployment whose
// Config.BuildTokenClaims hook fails (token.go:66-71 wraps that as an ordinary
// error) would get a generic 500 out of the compatibility wrapper where it used
// to get 403 2FA_REQUIRED — the one thing this PR promised not to change.

// with an empty TempToken and not as ErrTwoFactorRequired. This call's whole
// point is the token: a client handed a challenge without one would believe it
// had a step-up credential and be refused by every §3 route, and the sentinel
// would spell the 403 2FA_REQUIRED body this PR removed from /login — a wire
// answer no longer served on this route, telling the client to step up with a

// per-deployment only (config.email.sendMagicLink || config.email.mailer). So a
// deployment that can send mail offers magic-link to every challenged user, and
// the port keeps that: it is the sender on Config that decides, exactly as
// Auth.SMSConfigured decides for /sms/send.
//
// Two things this deliberately does not check:
//
//   - A verified address is not required for magic-link. The reference does not
//     check one (:559), the step-up branch of /magic-link/verify does not either
//     (Service.verifyMagicLink applies the verification side effect only on the
//     login path), and login has already refused an unverified user above unless
//     the deployment runs in lazy mode. Requiring one here would advertise fewer
//     methods than the routes accept.
//   - Config.Require2FA is not consulted. It is the trigger for a challenge, not
//     a method, and asking it here would advertise a factor nobody enrolled.
//
// The store-capability assertions have no counterpart in the reference, whose
// user store is one interface. They are this port's version of the same
// question — is this method wired up at all — and they only ever narrow the
// list: without them a deployment whose store cannot hold a magic-link token
