// implement — rather than the pre-0.2.0 spec this file used to carry, which
// documented four routes nobody mounted and none of the ones added since.
//
// Two things keep it from drifting again: every path here is registered by
// Adapter.Mount, and the wiretest suite replays each documented operation
// against every adapter to prove it is not a 404. A spec that advertises an

// Routes the reference has and this port does not (the admin router) are absent.

	// only under that configuration, exactly as the JWKS route does.
	//
	// It is a second flag rather than more of IDProvider because the two
	// describe different things to different readers. IDProvider publishes a
	// key so that somebody else's resource server can verify this IdP's

	// more — it is the only one a verifier calls. OIDC advertises an
	// authorization server a relying party is invited to drive. A deployment

	// (*IDP).RegisterHandlers under some other base path, leaves this false
	// and documents them where it mounted them.
