// never checked — including POST /logout, which the reference deliberately
// leaves unprotected so that a client with a stale CSRF cookie can still log
// out.
//
// This table is the contract for every route added later: a mutating route that
// is absent from it is CSRF-checked, so leaving an unauthenticated route out
// breaks it and putting an authenticated one in silently unprotects it. It is
// pinned method-by-method by TestCSRFExemptionsMatchTheReference.
//
// Four entries are not simply "routes without the auth middleware":
//   - POST /2fa/verify is a pre-login step-up call with no auth gate, so the
//     reference never CSRF-checks it (wire-contract §3, "CSRF does not apply
//     to: … /2fa/verify").
//   - POST /change-email/confirm has no auth gate either: the emailed token is
//     the credential, so the link has to work from a browser with no session and
//     no CSRF cookie at all (auth.router.ts:1040-1067).
//   - GET /verify-email is listed for completeness only. It is a GET, so it is
//     already exempt as a safe method and the entry can never be the reason a
//     request passes; recording it keeps the table a faithful transcription of
//     the reference's unauthenticated surface.
//   - /link-request is deliberately NOT here. It has no auth middleware but the
//     reference performs its own manual double-submit check inside the handler
//     (auth.router.ts:1489-1495), so it is the one unauthenticated route that
//     is CSRF-protected. It lives in csrfManualCheckRoutes instead, which is
//     what keeps it enforced even with no cookie credential on the request.
//

// csrfManualCheckRoutes are the routes the reference CSRF-checks by hand inside
// the handler instead of inheriting the check from its auth middleware. They are
// enforced whether or not the request is cookie-authenticated, which is what
// makes them different from every other enforced route.
//
// POST /link-request is the only entry, and it is deliberately not in
// csrfExemptRoutes. The reference mounts it without authMiddleware, then opens the
// handler with its own double-submit check gated only on `config.csrf.enabled`
// (auth.router.ts:1489-1495) — before it extracts any token (:1502). It has to:
// when no access token resolves, the handler falls back to the pending-link stash
// (:1513-1524), and that stash stands in for authentication for about an hour. So
// the route performs a write on behalf of an identity it did not authenticate,
// and the double-submit is the only thing standing between a cross-site form and
// that write.
//
// Do not fold this into csrfExemptRoutes. Being absent from the exempt table is
// not enough on its own: enforcement below is otherwise scoped to requests that
// carry an access-token cookie, and /link-request is precisely the route that
// needs checking when there is no such cookie. Without this table a pure forgery
// — no cookies, no Authorization, no headers — reaches linkRequest, which does no
// manual check of its own, and decodeJSON never inspects Content-Type, so an
// auto-submitting <form enctype="text/plain"> is enough. That overwrites any
// in-flight account-link token and mails the victim's address.
//
// [DEVIATION] One term of the reference's manual check is deliberately not
// reproduced: the bearer exemption. auth.router.ts:1489 gates the hand-written
// check on `config.csrf.enabled` alone, with no `usingBearer` term — unlike
// auth.middleware.ts:35 — so the reference answers 403 CSRF_INVALID to a
// bearer-authenticated POST /link-request that carries no double-submit pair.
// This port exempts a real bearer credential here as it does everywhere else, so
// that request succeeds. The divergence is:
//
//   - not a CSRF weakening. A cross-site page cannot set Authorization: the
//     header is not CORS-safelisted, so it costs a preflight the target must
//     approve, and the attacker has no token to put in it. Every request this
//     exempts is one the attacker could not have forged.
//   - the client-friendly direction, and the reference's own defect. The family
//     contract records it as a MISMATCH against the reference and notes it is
//     [UNTESTED] there: a native bearer client with no cookie jar "will fail this
//     check whenever CSRF is enabled server-side"
//     (docs/spec/wire-contract.md §4, POST /link-request, and mismatch summary
//     item 2). Reproducing it would break exactly those clients.
//   - invisible to a conforming client. A caller that sends the pair, as the
//     reference requires, is accepted by both.
//
// It predates csrfManualCheckRoutes — CSRFMiddleware has always short-circuited on
// usingBearerCredential — but this table is what makes the route's enforcement
// unconditional in every *other* respect, so the one remaining condition belongs
// here in writing. Pinned by TestCSRFManualCheckRouteExemptsARealBearerCredential;
