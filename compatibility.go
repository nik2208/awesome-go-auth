package auth

// This file is the register of the places this port knowingly does not
// reproduce awesome-node-auth.
//
// The standing rule is the opposite: reproduce the reference including its
// quirks, because the family's shipped clients (ng-awesome-node-auth,
// awesome-node-auth-flutter, the served auth.js) are pinned to it and this
// port's whole value is that they work against it unchanged. Every place the
// rule is set aside is therefore a fact a consumer needs, and until now those
// facts lived only in prose — README sections and CHANGELOG entries — which the
// next person could fold away in good faith with nothing failing.
//
// So this list is the single source of truth. The README's "Deliberate
// deviations from the reference" section is *generated* from it by
// compatibility_markdown.go, and compatibility_test.go regenerates that section
// and compares it byte for byte against the committed README. Editing an entry
// here without regenerating fails; editing the README by hand fails; adding a
// deviation without a README entry is not possible, because the README entry is
// this entry. The register test additionally pins the id set and the wire facts
// each entry has to keep stating, so that an entry cannot be hollowed out even
// by someone who does regenerate.
//
// Because the section is generated, the prose fields below are markdown: the
// backticks and emphasis a reader sees in the README are written here, once.
// They are ordinary sentences otherwise, and a caller that serialises the
// register gets prose it can render or strip as it likes.
//
// What belongs here: a deliberate, client-visible difference in behaviour. What
// does not: a bug (fix it), a feature the port has not reached yet (that is a
// gap, and belongs in an issue), or an internal implementation choice that no
// caller can observe on the wire.

// ReferenceRevision names the revision every Deviation.Citations entry resolves
// against. The citations are file:line, so they mean nothing without it.
const ReferenceRevision = "awesome-node-auth@cc01e997 (npm 1.9.0)"

// DevLineRevision names the second tree this package cites: nik2208/node-auth,
// the private line the published reference is cut from.
//
// Nothing in the deviation register resolves against it. Deviation.Citations is
// ReferenceRevision only, and compatibility_test.go enforces that. This
// constant exists because a few wire facts outside the register do come from
// the dev line, and a reader has to be able to tell which tree a file:line in a
// doc comment means: a citation written as "node-auth auth.router.ts:N" is this
// revision, a bare "auth.router.ts:N" is ReferenceRevision.
//
// One such fact exists today, and it is deliberate rather than accidental: the
// INVALID_INPUT refusal on POST /register (CodeInvalidInput in wire.go,
// ErrInvalidInput in errors.go, the check in Service.Register). The dev line
// mounts that route by default and gives its default handler a presence check
// on the two fields; the published reference mounts /register only when the
// host supplies options.onRegister (auth.router.ts:713), has no default handler
// at all, and therefore has no message and no code of its own there. Copying
// the dev line's answer is a bet that the published tree will grow the same
// one. When the dev line ships, ReferenceRevision moves forward and those
// citations fold back into it.
const DevLineRevision = "nik2208/node-auth@e8af923 (unreleased, package.json 1.9.0)"

// Deviation is one place this port deliberately answers differently from the
// reference.
//
// The two behaviours are recorded separately, and the reference's carries a
// citation, so that a reader can check the claim rather than take it — and so
// that a maintainer who changes one of them has to come here and say so.

					"intersected here, from this package's own settings store, and cross as a " +
					"closed list of ids a runner may narrow and must never widen. " +
