// These tests are what stops the deviation register drifting away from what the
// port actually does, and away from what the README tells a reader it does.
//
// The README half used to be a second copy, asserted only by identity: the test
// required every id and citation to appear somewhere in README.md. That caught a
// deletion and nothing else. An entry could be reworded on either side, weakened,
// or reversed outright — the README could assert the exact opposite of the
// register — and the suite stayed green. So the README section is now generated
// from CompatibilityNotes() and compared byte for byte, and the identity-only
// mirror test is gone: it asserted a subset of what the comparison asserts.
//
// What is left is three things, and the prose is deliberately still free within
// them:
//
//   - Identity, exactly. TestCompatibilityNotesRegister compares the whole ID
//     set. Dropping a deviation fails, and so does adding one — an addition has
//     to be a deliberate act, declared here as well as in the register.
//   - Sameness with the README, exactly.
//     TestREADMEIsGeneratedFromCompatibilityNotes re-renders the section and
//     compares it to the committed file, so a Go edit that was not regenerated
//     fails, and a README edit with no Go edit behind it fails.
//   - Substance, by load-bearing token. TestCompatibilityNotesClaims requires a
//     handful of wire facts per entry — the status codes, the header and field
//     names, the numbers, the reference mechanism. Generation alone cannot carry
//     this: someone who weakens an entry *and* regenerates has a green README.
//     These claims are what makes that fail too. They are what the entry means,
//     not how it is phrased, so a rewrite survives while a hollowing-out or a
//     reversal does not.
//   - Form. TestCompatibilityNotesAreWellFormed requires every field populated
//     and every citation shaped like file:line, so an entry cannot be reduced to
//     an unfalsifiable sentence with the evidence removed.

// updateREADME rewrites the generated section of README.md from the register
// instead of asserting against it. This is the regeneration path the section's
// own header comment points at:
//
//	go test -run TestREADMEIsGeneratedFromCompatibilityNotes -update .
